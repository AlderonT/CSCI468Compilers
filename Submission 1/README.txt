INTRODUCTION 
------------

Contained in this directory is an ELF executable for Linux 
called "micro" this file is the commulative work on the 
project that we have completed.

As of Step 1, this file contains the Lexer which prints out 
each token in the form of: 
    TOKEN TYPE: [TYPE]
    VALUE: [TOKEN VALUE]
These values will be used by the parser in Step 2
to build an Abstract Syntax Tree.
